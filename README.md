## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

The Nobel Prize, established in 1895, is one of the most prestigious recognitions awarded to individuals and organizations for exceptional contributions to various fields such as Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, and Peace. Despite the extensive data available about Nobel laureates, there is a lack of accessible, comprehensive, and visually engaging representations that analyze the geographic distribution and institutional affiliations of these winners over time. This gap limits the ability to understand how certain regions and institutions contribute disproportionately to global advancements and recognition in these fields.

Our project aims to address this gap by developing an **interactive visualization tool that maps the nationality, birthplaces, and institutional affiliations of Nobel Prize winners** from the inception of the prize to the present. By presenting this data in a dynamic, scrollable, and categorized format, we intend to offer a multifaceted view of the Nobel Prize landscape. Users will be able to explore the data year by year, observe trends in different award categories, and compare the representation of countries and institutions over time.

Additionally, the project aims to provide an aggregated summary view to present broader patterns and insights. This approach can help answer questions such as: Which countries have consistently produced Nobel laureates? Are there specific institutions that are frequently associated with Nobel-winning research? How have geopolitical changes influenced the distribution of Nobel Prizes over time?

The lack of such an accessible, visual representation can hinder educational institutions, researchers, and policymakers from gaining insights into the global distribution of intellectual achievements. Therefore, our project seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the historical and geographical dimensions of global intellectual contributions recognized by the Nobel Prize.

**Task Structure**:

1. Interactive global map with winner information for each country.
2. Offer users with yearly configuration panel.
3. Offer users with category selection panel.
4. Offer a static summary view for the broader patterns.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
>
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
