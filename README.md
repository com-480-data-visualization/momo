## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

TODO: The dataset was explored in which course before?

Several studies and visualizations have explored the Nobel Prize dataset, examining trends in laureate demographics, prize distribution, and interdisciplinary collaborations. The [Nobel Foundation](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/) provides an extensive historical archive of laureates, categorizing winners by year, discipline, and nationality. Additionally, the [Open Data Soft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/nobel-prize-laureates/table/?disjunctive.category) platform presents the dataset in an interactive table format, allowing users to filter laureates by category, birth country, and award year. The platform also offers basic visualizations, such as bar charts and maps, to highlight geographic distributions and historical trends. However, these representations remain relatively static and do not deeply explore temporal shifts or interdisciplinary connections.

Our approach is original in that it aims to synthesize multiple dimensions of Nobel Prize trends into a cohesive visual narrative. While prior analyses have often focused on one specific trend, we integrate multiple perspectives using innovative visualizations that make complex patterns more accessible. We plan to explore prize-sharing trends over time, interdisciplinary connections between scientific fields, and the migration backgrounds of laureates, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the evolving nature of scientific recognition.

Our visual inspiration comes from various sources beyond Nobel Prize studies. For example, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) and [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) provide excellent models for structuring historical data in a visually compelling manner.

This project builds upon previous explorations of the dataset in ____. The previous analyses primarily focused on statistical modeling or algorithmic approaches. In contrast, this submission for the data visualization course prioritizes storytelling and exploratory analysis. Rather than using predictive modeling or hypothesis testing, we emphasize intuitive visual representations that uncover historical shifts and scientific paradigms.
